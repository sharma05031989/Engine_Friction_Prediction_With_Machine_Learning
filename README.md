# Machine Learning Regression Algotithm to Predict I. C. Engine Friction


This algorithm predicts I C engine friction in terms of friction torque based on indepedant variable such as engine speed, oil temperature, coolant temperature and other data. 
At first stage, multivariate linear regression model is used without any data preprocessing. Next phase of work will include data preprocessing and friction torque prediction with various machine learning algorithm.
